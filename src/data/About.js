      'Nate always loved building things as a child. He would build anything from birdhouses to chicken coops, he loved all projects including restoring guitars. In Highschool, Nate was very involved in technical theater, building stage sets and platforms. After high school, Nate did not immediately start in the construction business. After serving a church mission, Nate attended school and became a veterinary technician. For 4 years, he worked as a vet tech in an equine hospital. Although his love for horses never changed, he found his career path changed drastically when he decided that joining forces with Rodney in a construction business would be rewarding. Nate had previously done small jobs, after work, with Rodney.',
